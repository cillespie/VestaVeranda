**Tweet 1:**
Your fire pit could be destroying your composite deck.

But it doesn't have to.

Here's exactly how to enjoy fire pit nights without ruining your $10k+ deck:

🧵

**Tweet 2:**
1/ First, understand the risk:

Composite decks can warp and melt at temps above 450°F.

Most fire pits reach 600°F+ at the base.

That's a recipe for disaster without proper protection.

---

**Tweet 3:**
2/ The simple solution: Height matters.

Elevate your fire pit at least 12" off the deck surface.

This allows air circulation and prevents direct heat transfer.

Look for fire pits with built-in stands.

---

**Tweet 4:**
3/ Must-have accessory: Heat-resistant mat

Place it under your fire pit setup.

It catches embers AND creates a thermal barrier.

Worth every penny for deck protection.

---

**Tweet 5:**
4/ Consider propane over wood-burning

Propane fire pits:
✓ Lower base temperatures
✓ No flying embers
✓ Easier to control
✓ Less smoke

Perfect for deck settings.

---

**Tweet 6:**
TL;DR for safe fire pits on composite decks:

• Elevate 12"+ off surface
• Use heat-resistant mat
• Consider propane
• Never leave unattended
• Check manufacturer guidelines
