19:56
chat GPT, looks really messy, but here
19:59
is where it all comes together. You
20:01
simply want to say at the end, of all
20:03
these perfumes, select five. Just tell
20:06
me the names that fit best into each of
20:08
the following categories. And I've said
20:10
best perfume for office, date night,
20:12
best going out perfume for daily use,
20:14
and hot weather. And I'll simply hit
20:16
enter. So it's given us these five for
20:18
each scenario. Best perfume for hot
20:20
weather, Creed Love in White for summer.
20:23
Already sounds right to me. So what
20:24
we're going to do at this stage is you
20:26
want to go back over to Amazon and
20:28
simply copy over each one of these
20:31
names. Type them into the search bar as
20:33
I've done for this first example. Simply
20:36
get the link for each of them, which you
20:38
can very simply copy. And you want to
20:41
make note of each one of these five
20:43
different perfumes for each one of those
20:45
different occasions like I've done over
20:47
here. And once you've got each affiliate
20:49
link for each one of those perfumes, you
20:51
simply want to say next to each one of
20:52
them, promote and recommend this perfume
20:55
in article naturally using affiliate
20:57
link. And I'll paste in that affiliate
20:58
link. And I'll do exactly the same for
21:00
the remaining four. And once you've done
21:02
that for all five perfume affiliate
21:04
products, the bulk of our work is pretty
21:06
much done. You simply want to select
21:08
all, rightclick, copy, head back over to
21:11
Horizons, simply paste it in, and then
21:13
hit enter. And your first article will
21:16
now be created with each of those
21:18
affiliate links placed into that article
21:20
naturally. So, it does take a while. I'm
21:22
going to pause the video and I'll see
21:24
you in a second. So, that first article
21:25
is now created. Let's take a look at it
21:27
to see if we're happy with it. So, I'm
21:29
going to click onto it. The five best
21:31
luxury perfumes for every occasion. So
21:34
far, I'm very happy with that featured
21:36
image, which also features at the
21:38
headline image. First up, a curated
21:40
guide to the finest luxury fragrances
21:42
for every moment of your life, from the
21:44
boardroom to a romantic evening under
21:46
the stars. And it goes straight in to
21:49
recommend the perfect office fragrance.
21:52
And here we have a call to action
21:54
saying, "Discover this office
21:55
essential." If I click onto it, guys,
21:57
that does go directly to our affiliate
22:00
link. That's absolutely perfect. And it
22:02
repeats exactly the same for each one of
22:05
those different situations. So, your
22:07
signature daily scent, strong call to
22:10
action, really good image over there.
22:12
You got these sort of tags as well. If I
22:14
scroll down, your ideal date night
22:16
scents, got a picture of a cocktail. And
22:19
what I love is how it sort of varied the
22:21
language in each one of these call to
22:23
actions, right? Discover this office
22:25
essential. Shop your signature scent.
22:28
Find your date night scent. Here we have
22:30
the ultimate going out fragrance. Shop
22:33
the ultimate night scent. And of course,
22:34
we've got the essential hot weather
22:37
perfume with an image of the beach and
22:40
the sun. Shop this summer essential.
22:42
Again, each of them linking to our
22:44
affiliate link. And at the bottom, what
22:46
I've also noticed is it's even provided
22:48
an affiliate disclaimer, which is
22:50
important. Essence may earn a commission
22:52
when you buy through links on our site.
22:54
Of course, Essence is the brand name
22:56
that Hostinger Horizons gave us without
22:58
us even asking. So, once you're happy
23:00
with your article, you can simply click
23:02
onto where it says publish and anything
23:05
that you want to change. Literally
23:06
anything, type it in to the AI chatbot
23:08
on the left hand side, and it will
23:10
change exactly what you ask it to
23:12
change. So, I'm very happy with it as it
23:14
is. I'm simply going to click onto where
23:16
it says publish, and I'll copy over the
23:17
URL for that particular article. go back
23:20
over to our Pinterest pin, paste that in
23:22
as a destination link, and I'll simply
23:25
publish immediately. And the quality of
23:27
our published pin and that corresponding
23:29
article containing our affiliate links
23:32
is extremely high, which is extremely
23:34
important when it comes to Pinterest
23:36
affiliate marketing. They far exceed, in
23:39
my opinion, even the most popular of
23:42
pins being searched for in the shopping
23:44
niche under which we are competing with
23:47
other affiliate marketers. And of
23:49
course, the more pins and corresponding
23:51
articles containing those affiliate
23:52
links that you create, especially if
23:55
they correspond with what buyer traffic
23:57
are specifically searching for on
23:58
Pinterest, which I showed you exactly
24:00
how to identify the more in those
24:02
affiliate marketing commissions that we
24:04
can generate. This has honestly got to
24:06
be one of the fastest ways to actually
24:08
get started with Pinterest affiliate
24:10
marketing without sacrificing quality by
24:13
implementing a proven working strategy
24:16
that can work over the long term that
24:18
thousands of affiliate marketers are
24:20
implementing successfully on Pinterest.
24:23
And of course, we were able to set this
24:25
up in only a fraction of the time by
24:27
utilizing two AI tools that is Hostinger
24:30
and Kit. Again guys, links in the
24:32
description of this video, discount
24:34
codes next to those links. And by
24:36
clicking on to my link for KD, you will
24:38
get access to that flow to that template
24:40
that I just set up, which you can very
24:42
easily copy, edit, and refine to promote
24:45
any affiliate product that you so
24:47
choose. And of course, the affiliate
24:49
product that you do promote, you can
24:51
also select from the affiliate guide
24:53
that I've also linked to in the video
24:55
description containing five affiliate
24:58
products and programs that you can get
25:00
signed up to right away. No approval
25:02
process needed. And if you want to know
25:04
how to drive even more buyer traffic to
25:06
your affiliate links, I'm talking those
